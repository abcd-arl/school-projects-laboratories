# Depth-First Search Algorithm

## Instruction

Implement in a computer program the given problem in depth-limited search.
Write your program in a document. With the screenshots of your results.

Example:

Make sure that your program will input the required number of edges, the required number of vertices and the format of your tree. In the above example the tree looks like this:

## Submission

The program performs a depth-limited search from a graph by searching the target node within a limit level. It prompts the user to input the number of vertices and edges of the graph and the target value and limit level to perform. It also automatically outputs the structure of the graph in an adjacency list. Finally, it outputs the path taken and informs the user if the target is found or not.

The output of the program where the target is found within the limits
