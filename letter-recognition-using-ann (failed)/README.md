# Letter Recognition Using ANN

## Instruction

Create a pattern recognition neural network. The pattern is a handwritten letter A, both capital and small letter. This program should be written in any programming language. Write your program in a document together with its output. The size of where to write the letter would be 28x28.

## Submission

I failed to build a functioning model. The model I trained gained high accuracy in evaluation but performs poorly in prediction.


In my program, the model is able to guess images with no problem from the testing set.

However, it is not able to predict properly. In this GUI, the output should equal 0 if it is in uppercase and 1 if it is in lowercase. Both seem to appear 0 in any case.
